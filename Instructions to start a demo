# Giraff-ROS-Nodes
Instructions to start a demo
Before starting ROS we need to upload node to processors

1. This link:(https://github.com/bogamct/Giraff-ROS-Nodes/blob/master/MotorControl-encoders-ROSnode) consists of motorControl with EncoderInfo ROSnode which has to be uploaded in Giraff low level board (ATmega644 ,which is connected to S0 port of on board computer) using Arduino IDE   
2. This link :(https://github.com/bogamct/Giraff-ROS-Nodes/blob/master/Acceleromoter-NODE) consists of Accelerometer ROSnode which has to be uploaded in ArduinoUNO assembled with 9 Axes Motion Sheild.
3. This link :(https://github.com/Karthik-Sur/Ultrasonic_Sensor/blob/master/Timer_ROS/Timer_ROS.ino) consists of Ultasonic ROSnode which has to be uploaded in Arduino Mega(where Ultrasonic Sensors are connected ) 

4. The below commands should be in Giraff on board computer
.bashrc file should consists of
export ROS_IP=192.168.1.143
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.143:11311

4.1 In a terminal (start ROS MASTER)
    ssh giraff@192.168.1.143
    roscore
4.2 In new terminal (start motorControl with EncoderInfo ROSnode)
    ssh giraff@192.168.1.143
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node1.py _port:=/dev/ttyS0
4.3 In new terminal (start Ultrasonic node )
    ssh giraff@192.168.1.143
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node2.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0

    
5.These commands has to be uploaded in the computer where Accelerometer is connected
.bashrc file should consists of
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.143:11311 (this command is used to mention that Giraff computer has ROS master)
export ROS_IP=<computer's IP addresss>
In terminal 
5.1 rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0
    
    
    Now you can control robot through Accelerometer and track data using rostopic echo /topicname
